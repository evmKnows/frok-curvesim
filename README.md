# Curvesim
Curvesim simulates Curve pools with optimal arbitrageurs trading against them to determine reasonable risk and reward parameters, such as amplitude (A) and fee, given historical price and volume feeds.

Users can re-use simulation components to simulate custom strategies and generate custom metrics.  Pool objects enable simpler integration with Curve pools for both manual and automated analytics usage.
